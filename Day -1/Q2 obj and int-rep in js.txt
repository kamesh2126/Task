#  objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

* 1 ---> Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building
      blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from
      JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined
      and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a
      single value each (depending on their types).

var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Ford';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 1969;

* 2 ---> The JavaScript runtime uses the object wrapper to access and modify the
     object's properties and methods. When you access a property or method on
     an object, the runtime uses the object wrapper to find the property or
     method and then calls it.
