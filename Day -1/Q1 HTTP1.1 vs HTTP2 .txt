 Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


# HTTP 1.1
 * Point no:1 ---> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol,
         or HTTP, is an application protocol that has been the de facto standard
         for communication on the World Wide Web since its invention in 1989. 
         From the release of HTTP/1.1 in 1997 until recently, 
         there have been few revisions to the protocol.

  * Point no: 2 ---> Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989
           As a communication standard for the World Wide Web,
            HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges,
            information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.     


 # HTTPS2 

  * Point no:1 --->  HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google,
          with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques 
          such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.This protocol served 
          As a template for HTTP/2 when the Hypertext Transfer Protocol working group
          httpbis of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) put the standard together.

   * Point no: 2 ---> From a technical point of view, one of the most significant features that 
             distinguishes HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is the binary framing layer, which can be
             thought of as a part of the application layer in the internet protocol stack. 
             As opposed to HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text
            format, HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format
